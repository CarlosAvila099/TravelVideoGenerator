For the program to work, the images have to have location and timestamp.
Please create a folder named "Images" and place it in the same folder as the package "TravelVideo".
Inside the folder Images place all the images and videos.

PD: The video generator will crop images and videos if it is necesary, as I couldn't make it to expand the images and videos. (The original Images will not be moddified)
